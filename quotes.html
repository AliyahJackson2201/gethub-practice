<p>
"I wish I could do whatever I liked behind the curtain of "madness". <br />
Then: I'd arrange flowers,<br />
all day long,<br />
I'd paint; pain, love and tenderness,<br />
I would laugh as much as I feel like at the stupidity of others, and they would all say: "Poor thing, she's crazy!"<br />
... I would build my world which while I lived, would be in agreement with all the worlds.<br />
The day, or the hour, or the minute that I lived would be mine and everyone else's<br />
- my madness would not be an escape from "reality"."<br />
- Frida Kahlo<p/>
